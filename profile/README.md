### Background
The industrial sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States, accounting for 30% of energy-related CO₂ emissions with 1,360 million metric tons released in 20201. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is a greenhouse gas that absorbs and retains heat in Earth's atmosphere, contributing to global warming, disrupting ecosystems, accelerating ice melt, and amplifying extreme weather events. Dr. Eric Masanet and his research team at the Industrial Sustainability Analysis Laboratory, at the University of California, Santa Barbara, address this challenge by developing industrial decarbonization pathways that illuminate needed technology transitions. One of their key data sources is  the Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC) database, which contains over 40 years of industrial energy efficiency audits and recommendations, a program funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and managed by over 50 universities across the country. Even though it is a valuable resource, the IAC database has several limitations. It lacks information on potential savings in GHG emissions and local air pollutants, and does not adjust for changes in technology costs over time. Additionally, it provides limited data visualization capabilities and its frequent updates complicate real-time analysis. This project aims to address these gaps by developing a publicly accessible interface that integrates GHG emissions, air pollutants, and other key data with the IAC database, and adjusts economic metrics to present values for historical data. By streamlining access to critical data and expanding analytical and data visualization capabilities, this tool will accelerate research into industrial energy efficiency and support broader decarbonization efforts in the manufacturing sector.
